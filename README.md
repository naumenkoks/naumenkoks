🎮 Kirill | Aspiring Game Developer

Hi! I'm Kirill, an aspiring game developer transitioning from data analytics into the creative world of gameplay programming and design. I find joy in crafting engaging mechanics and bringing game worlds to life using Unity and C# — and soon Unreal Engine & C++ too.

## 🚀 My GameDev Journey So Far
- Built and published multiple 2D Unity games (see pinned projects 👇)
- Learning clean, modular scripting and gameplay logic
- Focused on player feel, feedback, and meaningful game interaction
- Practicing core systems like physics, particle FX, collision detection, and camera control
- Currently completing GameDev.tv’s comprehensive Unity 2D course

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- Unity (2D), C#, Git, GitHub
- Learning: Unity 3D, C++, Unreal Engine 5
- Background: SQL, Python, Tableau, data engineering

## 🎯 My Goal
To join a passionate game development team — small or large — where I can contribute to gameplay programming, systems design, and fun player experiences. I'm open to remote and on-site roles across the EU.

Let’s build something awesome together!
